# n8iv.js [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/constantology/n8iv.png)](http://travis-ci.org/constantology/n8iv)

n8iv is a functional programming library – for modern javascript engines – which correctly extends JavaScript Natives. Giving you a – relatively – safe and easy to use API, to make your code more succinct and efficient.

n8iv is based on the awesomeness of [prototypejs](https://github.com/savetheclocktower/prototype).

If you like the idea of having one global variable with a bunch of static functions – in no particular order – attached to it, then this is probably not the framework for you.

If you think that extending JavaScript Natives is a "bad part" of JavaScript, then this is probably not the framework for you.

If, however, you like your methods bound to your types, then come on in and sit a spell!

**n8iv will not overwrite any implementations – native or otherwise – of any methods, properties or accessors already defined.**

## Dependencies

n8iv.js only has one dependency [m8.js](/constantology/m8).

**NOTE:**
If you are using n8iv within a commonjs module, you don't need to require m8 before requiring n8iv as this is done internally and a reference to **m8** is available as: `n8iv.m8`.

```javascript

   var n8iv = require( 'n8iv' ),
       m8  = n8iv.m8; // <= reference to m8

// if running in a sandboxed environment remember to:
   m8.x( Object, Array, Boolean, Function, String ); // and/ or any other Types that require extending.
// alternatively, this does the same and returns the n8iv global
   n8iv( Object, Array, Boolean, Function, String );

```

See [m8: Extending into the future](/constantology/m8) for more information on working with sandboxed modules.

## Support

Tested to work with nodejs, FF4+, Safari 5+, Chrome 7+, IE9+. Should technically work in any browser that supports [ecma 5]( http://kangax.github.com/es5-compat-table/) without throwing any JavaScript errors.
